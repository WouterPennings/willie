# Willie

Wilie is a discord bit written in [Python](https://python.org). He is made for the [Loop Discord Server](https://discord.gg/T3tqQBTyJA) so people can play around with Loop without needing the compiler. Willie needs to be **very** simple, basicly only one command: _!Run_

## What is Loop
Loop is a programming language that is implemented in Rust. It is trying to tackle the problems of needing C to develop fast programs in Python. The goal is to make [Loop](https://looplang.org) blazing fast **and** easy, so a secondary language is unnecessary. 

Where to find Loop:
- [Website](https://looplang.org)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/looplanguage)
